You can test how it works here:
  http://188.127.251.190:3002

To install:
  backend
    yarn install
  frontend
    yarn install

To launch:
  backend
    yarn start
  frontend
    yarn start

To running tests:
  backend
    yarn test

What can be imporoved:
  1. redux can decrease backend usage if this will be needed
  3. complex frontend tests
